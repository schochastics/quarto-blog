This is just a short announcement post that the R package oaqc is back on CRAN.

The package provides an efficient algorithm to calculate for a given graph the orbit-aware quad census. More precisely the frequency distribution of all induced and non-induced non-isomorphic four node subgraphs, i.e. quads, on a node and edge level; see the figure below for the relation between orbit and quad.

The package was archived because the original authors were not reachable anymore. I tracked them down and got their permission to maintain the package.

The new GitHub repository is <https://github.com/schochastics/oaqc>. Most importantly, the package now also has a hexsticker

Below is a short example for how to use the package.

## Input

The input can either be an edgelist (matrix or data.frame) or a graph Object ('igraph')

Despite the input format the graph should not contain loops 
or multi-edges and the vertex indices have to lie in range 
[0,n-1) with n denoting the number of vertices in the graph. 
Note that if the smallest index is 1 the algorithm will create
an isolated vertex with index 0.

## Calculating the orbit-aware quad census

The following code exemplifies the use of this package.

```{r}
library(oaqc)
### k4, pure R
k4 <- data.frame(
    source = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2),
    target = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3)
)
k4orbits <- oaqc(k4, non_ind_freq = FALSE, file = "")
k4orbits
```
