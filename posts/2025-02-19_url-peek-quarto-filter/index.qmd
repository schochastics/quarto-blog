When writing documents, it's often useful to provide some context for links, especially when the URL itself 
isn't visible in the text. For example, if you reference a resource with [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), 
the reader doesn't immediately know where the link leads unless they hover over it or click.

To address this, I created `url-peek`, a small Quarto filter that automatically adds the domain of a link in
brackets after the link text. This gives readers a quick visual cue about the destination without cluttering the document too much.

## How it works

With `url-peek`, a link like this:

```md
[link](https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-url-peek))
```

would render as

```html
<a href="https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-url-peek">link</a> [github.com]
```
Here is a visual example:

This keeps the document readable while still providing useful context.

## Customization

The extension also allows some customization of how the domain is displayed. 
You can adjust the text color and font size by setting parameters in your Quarto document's metadata.

For example, to style the domain in blue and set the font size to 12px, you can add this to your YAML header:

```yaml
domain_style:
  color: "blue"
  font_size: "14px"
```

This helps integrate the preview into different styles and formats without disrupting the overall design of the document.


## Install

```bash
quarto add schochastics/quarto-url-peek
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory. 
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Summary

This is really is just a small utility, but I think it can
add context to external links without making the document visually noisy and 
help readers identify trusted sources at a glance.
