More precisely the frequency distribution of all induced and non-induced non-isomorphic four node subgraphs, i.e. quads, on a node and edge level; see the figure below for the relation between orbit and quad.\n\n![](quad_census.svg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe package was archived because the original authors were not reachable anymore. I tracked them down and got their permission to maintain the package.\n\nThe new GitHub repository is <https://github.com/schochastics/oaqc>. Most importantly, the package now also has a hexsticker\n\n![](logo.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nBelow is a short example for how to use the package.\n\n## Input\n\nThe input can either be an edgelist (matrix or data.frame) or a graph Object ('igraph')\n\nDespite the input format the graph should not contain loops \nor multi-edges and the vertex indices have to lie in range \n[0,n-1) with n denoting the number of vertices in the graph. \nNote that if the smallest index is 1 the algorithm will create\nan isolated vertex with index 0.\n\n## Calculating the orbit-aware quad census\n\nThe following code exemplifies the use of this package.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(oaqc)\n### k4, pure R\nk4 <- data.frame(\n    source = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2),\n    target = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3)\n)\nk4orbits <- oaqc(k4, non_ind_freq = FALSE, file = \"\")\nk4orbits\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$n_orbits_ind\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14]\n[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     0\n[2,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     0\n[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     0\n[4,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     0\n     [,15] [,16] [,17] [,18] [,19] [,20]\n[1,]     0     0     0     0     0     1\n[2,]     0     0     0     0     0     1\n[3,]     0     0     0     0     0     1\n[4,]     0     0     0     0     0     1\n\n$e_orbits_ind\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14]\n[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n[2,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n[4,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n[5,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n[6,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     0     1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::",
